"""HTTP surface of the `transport_ops` module (C4) — Phase 10.4. `students_router` mounts at
`/api/v1/students` (`interfaces/http/api_v1.py`); `parents_router`/`routes_router`/
`trips_router` remain empty — Phase 10.1-10.3 built only the `Student` aggregate, and this
phase's own scope is the Student API only.

Thin controllers only (Backend LLD §16.2): parse the request DTO, call exactly one
`StudentApplicationService` method, return the response DTO. No business logic, no repository/
SQLAlchemy access, no aggregate manipulation — every error raised by the application/domain
layers already maps to the standard `ErrorEnvelope` via the global exception handlers
(`core/errors/handlers.py`, registered once in `main.py`); routers never build an error
response themselves. Mirrors `organization`/`fleet_device`/`tracking.api.routers`'s shape
exactly, including the `require_permission`-pending-RBAC-matrix posture
(`interfaces/http/deps.py`): every route below is authorization-gated the same way, so it
currently raises `NotImplementedError` (500) rather than a guessed permission matrix, per API
Contracts §4.3's role column ("Org Admin") and §3.1's authorization layering.

**Five routes, matching API Contracts §4.3's `/students` rows exactly** (lines 122-123):
- `POST /students` — enroll (the doc's uniform "`GET/POST /students`" create half)
- `GET /students` — list (the doc's uniform "`GET/POST /students`" list half) — the **first
  list endpoint in this codebase**: `iam`/`organization`/`fleet_device`/`tracking` all
  deliberately deferred their own `GET /x` (list) routes because no listing use-case existed
  in their Application layers yet. `transport_ops` is different: Phase 10.2 already built
  `ListStudentsQuery`/`list_students`, and Phase 10.3 already gave it a working (if
  tenant-*un*scoped — see that phase's own flagged gap, `infra/repositories.py`'s module
  docstring) infra implementation. Declining to expose it here would mean sitting on a
  complete, working use-case for no documented reason — so, unlike the precedent modules, this
  route **is** implemented, carrying the inherited scoping caveat forward via this docstring
  rather than silently presenting it as production-ready.
- `GET /students/{id}` — get by id (uniform CRUD, API Contracts §4 preamble)
- `PATCH /students/{id}` — update `full_name`/`external_ref` (uniform CRUD; see
  `UpdateStudentRequest`'s docstring for why `status` is not accepted here)
- `POST /students/{id}/status` — activate/disable/graduate/transfer, dispatched by the
  `status` value (API Contracts §4.3 line 123 verbatim; see `UpdateStudentStatusRequest`'s
  docstring for the `active`-is-also-accepted interpretation)

**Endpoints deliberately not implemented** (documented, not silently dropped):
- `DELETE /students/{id}` (uniform-CRUD soft delete, §4 preamble) — `Student` has no
  soft-delete domain behavior (Database Design §9 keeps soft delete and business status
  explicitly separate concepts, `deleted_at` vs. `status`); same deferral `iam`/`fleet_device`
  already apply to `DELETE /users`/`DELETE /vehicles`.

**Phase 10.6: `parents_router` — four routes, matching API Contracts §4.3's `/parents` row**
(line 124: `GET/POST /parents | Org Admin |`, no notes column, unlike `/students`' explicit
`/status` sub-route line):
- `POST /parents` — register
- `GET /parents` — list (same inherited unrestricted-`TenantRegionScope` caveat as
  `list_students`)
- `GET /parents/{id}` — get by id (uniform CRUD)
- `PATCH /parents/{id}` — update `full_name`/`phone`/`status` **together** — unlike
  `Student`'s split between a details-only `PATCH` and a dedicated `POST .../status` route,
  `Parent` has no documented behavioral status sub-route to dispatch to, so `status` folds
  into the uniform `PATCH` instead, mirroring `organization.api.routers.update_organization`/
  `fleet_device.api.routers.update_vehicle`'s status-in-PATCH shape (via
  `UpdateParentRequest`, which — like `iam.api.schemas.UpdateUserRequest` — composes multiple
  optional fields into one request, each independently dispatched, not atomically).
- `DELETE /parents/{id}` not implemented, for the identical reason `DELETE /students/{id}`
  isn't: `Parent` has no soft-delete domain behavior.

**Phase 10.7: Parent<->Student relationship — four routes, no documented API Contracts route
at all** (confirmed by re-reading §4.3 in full: the `/students`/`/parents` rows list no linking
sub-route, unlike `/routes/{id}/stops`'s documented "ordered stops" nesting). Modeled as nested
sub-resource collections under the two existing routers — the one documented precedent in this
same table for a child collection nested under a parent resource — rather than inventing a new
top-level `/student-parents` router:

- `POST /students/{student_id}/parents` — link (`students_router`) — body `{parent_id,
  relationship?, is_primary?}`. Cross-organization/duplicate/not-found rejections all surface
  through the standard error envelope automatically (`DomainError`/`ConflictError`/
  `NotFoundError` from `application/services.py` and `domain/entities.py`).
- `DELETE /students/{student_id}/parents/{parent_id}` — unlink (`students_router`) — the
  **first real `DELETE` in this module**: unlike `Student`/`Parent`'s deferred soft-delete,
  removing a link is a genuine deletion (`domain/entities.py`'s `StudentParent` docstring), so
  this is the correct semantics, not a gap being filled in.
- `GET /students/{student_id}/parents` — list a student's parents (`students_router`).
- `GET /parents/{parent_id}/students` — list a parent's students (`parents_router`).

**Phase 10.8: `drivers_router` — four routes, `/drivers` (Database Design §6.1, ADR-0001).
Flagged, not silently assumed: unlike `/students`/`/parents`, API Contracts §4.3 documents
*no* `/drivers` resource row at all** (re-read in full before implementing — the only
`Driver`-related rows are `/trips/{id}/driver` PATCH, `/trips/{id}/start`, `/trips/{id}/end`,
all `Trip`-aggregate concerns, not `Driver`-profile CRUD). Built anyway, for the same reason
Phase 10.7 built `StudentParent`'s routes despite an identical documentation gap: Database
Design §6.1 unambiguously defines the `drivers` table and ADR-0001 unambiguously assigns it to
this module, the task's own requirements explicitly ask for "FastAPI endpoints", and API
Contracts §4's own preamble establishes a *uniform CRUD pattern per resource* that this
resource simply isn't enumerated under (the `4.3` table is headed "(representative)" — not
exhaustive). This is a real documentation gap, reported here rather than silently decided:

- `POST /drivers` — register (uniform CRUD)
- `GET /drivers` — list (same inherited unrestricted-`TenantRegionScope` caveat as
  `list_students`/`list_parents`)
- `GET /drivers/{id}` — get by id (uniform CRUD)
- `PATCH /drivers/{id}` — update `license_no`/`status` together, mirroring `update_parent`'s
  exact shape (no dedicated behavioral status sub-route is documented for `/drivers` either)
- `DELETE /drivers/{id}` not implemented, for the identical reason `DELETE /students/{id}`/
  `DELETE /parents/{id}` aren't: `Driver` has no soft-delete domain behavior.

**Phase 11: `routes_router` — six routes, matching API Contracts §4.3's `/routes` rows.**
Unlike `Driver`/`StudentParent`, this phase's core routes **are** documented (line 125:
`GET/POST /routes | Org Admin |`; line 126: `GET/POST /routes/{id}/stops | Org Admin | ordered
stops`) — no documentation gap for these six:

- `POST /routes` — create (the doc's uniform "`GET/POST /routes`" create half)
- `GET /routes` — list (the doc's uniform "`GET/POST /routes`" list half; same inherited
  unrestricted-`TenantRegionScope` caveat as `list_students`/`list_parents`/`list_drivers`)
- `GET /routes/{id}` — get by id (uniform CRUD; embeds the route's ordered stops)
- `PATCH /routes/{id}` — update `name`/`status` together, mirroring `update_parent`'s exact
  shape (no dedicated behavioral status sub-route is documented for `/routes` either, and no
  `archived` status value exists to dispatch to — see `domain/entities.py`'s module docstring)
- `POST /routes/{route_id}/stops` — add a stop (API Contracts §4.3 line 126 verbatim: "ordered
  stops"). Returns the created `StopResponse`, mirroring `StudentParentLinkResponse`'s
  "POST-to-a-nested-collection returns the created child" shape (Phase 10.7) rather than the
  whole parent — the closer precedent here than `fleet_device`'s `register_camera` (which has
  no HTTP route at all to set a response-shape precedent from).
- `GET /routes/{route_id}/stops` — list a route's stops, already ordered by `sequence_no`
  (`domain/entities.py`'s `Route.stops` property).

**Documentation gap encountered and flagged, not silently decided:** API Contracts §4.3 line
126 documents only `GET/POST /routes/{id}/stops` for the stops sub-resource — no route exists
for updating, removing, or reordering an individual stop. `Route.remove_stop`/`Route.move_stop`
and their application-service/command counterparts (`application/services.py`,
`application/commands.py`) are fully implemented and unit-tested, but **no HTTP endpoint is
exposed for them this phase** — mirroring `fleet_device.api.routers`'s identical restraint for
`RegisterCameraCommand` ("routes are contract-driven, not capability-driven"). A future API
Contracts revision that documents `PATCH`/`DELETE /routes/{route_id}/stops/{stop_id}` can wire
these straight through with no domain/application change.

**Endpoints deliberately not implemented:**
- `DELETE /routes/{id}` (uniform-CRUD soft delete, §4 preamble) — `Route` has no soft-delete
  domain behavior, the identical deferral `DELETE /students/{id}`/`DELETE /parents/{id}`/
  `DELETE /drivers/{id}` already apply.

**Phase 12: `trips_router` — six routes.** Matches API Contracts §4.3 lines 129-132 for five of
them; the sixth (`GET /trips/{id}`) is this phase's own uniform-CRUD addition, flagged below:

- `POST /trips` — schedule (the doc's uniform "`GET/POST /trips`" create half; line 129, "Org
  Admin", "scheduled trips").
- `GET /trips` — list (the list half of the same line; same inherited unrestricted-
  `TenantRegionScope` caveat every other list endpoint in this module carries).
- `GET /trips/{id}` — get by id. Not literally itemized in §4.3's compact table (only
  `GET/POST /trips` appears), but every sibling resource in this module has this uniform-CRUD
  route (API Contracts §4 preamble) — built for the same reason `Driver`'s whole resource was,
  flagged here rather than silently assumed.
- `POST /trips/{id}/start` — line 130, **Driver (own)** → `TripStarted`. No request body (the
  documented "Trip start response" sample shows no request example).
- `POST /trips/{id}/end` — line 131, **Driver (own)** → `TripEnded`. No request body, same
  reasoning.
- `PATCH /trips/{id}/driver` — line 132, **Org Admin**, body `{driver_id}` verbatim — "change
  driver — no device change".

**`start`/`end` are this module's first "Driver (own)" routes** — every prior route in
`transport_ops` is Org-Admin-only. Actually verifying the calling driver owns the trip (i.e.
`principal.user_id` resolves to `trip.driver_id`'s linked `iam.User`) is part of the still-
pending RBAC/scope work (`require_permission` raises `NotImplementedError` here exactly like
every other route in this module) — not built this phase, the same deferral already applied to
the permission matrix itself.

**Not exposed this phase** (flagged, not silently dropped): `Trip.interrupt`/`resume`
(`InterruptTripCommand`/`ResumeTripCommand`) have no approved HTTP route — no documented
`/trips/{id}/interrupt` or `/trips/{id}/resume` path exists anywhere in API Contracts §4.3 —
mirroring `Route.remove_stop`/`move_stop`'s identical "use-case exists, no approved endpoint
yet" posture; a generic `PATCH /trips/{id}` and `DELETE /trips/{id}` — no field beyond `driver`
is documented as post-creation-editable, and `Trip` has no soft-delete domain behavior, the
identical deferral every other `DELETE` in this module already applies.
