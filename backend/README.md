# Backend — RAAD Business API

FastAPI modular-monolith serving the RAAD Business API. Owns REST + WebSocket delivery to the web
dashboard and mobile app, all business logic, and the transactional outbox that feeds the event bus.
Never terminates a device socket (JT808/JT1078 are separate deployables — see `services/`).

Source of truth: `docs/business/RAAD_Phase3.1_Backend_LLD_v1_2.md`.

## Modules (bounded contexts)

| Module | Context |
|---|---|
| `iam` | Identity & Access — authN, RBAC, sessions |
| `organization` | Organization/Tenant — customer orgs, settings, region hierarchy |
| `fleet_device` | Vehicles and GPS/MDVR devices, assignment lifecycle |
| `transport_ops` | Students, parents, drivers, routes, stops, trips |
| `tracking` | Position ingestion, live state, geofence evaluation |
| `video` | Live-video/playback session control (Org Admin only) |
| `notifications` | Event-driven notification rules and delivery (FCM + in-app) |
| `billing` | Plans, subscriptions, invoices, payments, transport fees |
| `reporting` | Operational/payment reports, dashboards, exports |
| `platform_audit` | System settings, audit log, integrations |

Every module follows the identical internal shape documented in `.claude/rules/backend.md` and
`.claude/rules/architecture.md`. Modules never read another module's tables directly — see
`.claude/rules/database.md`.

## Business entity → module mapping

There is no separate module per business entity — entities are grouped into the ten bounded
contexts above by domain cohesion, per the Phase 2 Domain Architecture (§2) and Phase 3.2 Database
Design. No required entity is missing; each is intentionally merged into the context that owns it:

| Business entity | Bounded context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| School / Transport Company / Fleet Company (i.e. **Organization**) | `organization` | "School" is a customer `Organization` (`org_type`), not a distinct module — Ch. 6.2. |
| **Student** | `transport_ops` | Owns student ↔ route/stop/parent assignment (`student_assignments`). |
| **Parent** | `transport_ops` | `parents`, `student_parents` — kept with Student rather than IAM because parent access is entirely transport-assignment-scoped, not a general identity concern. |
| **Driver** | `transport_ops` | `drivers` — operational profile tied to trips/vehicles, not device/fleet hardware. |
| **Vehicle** | `fleet_device` | Vehicle is the asset; paired 1:1 with **Device** (GPS/MDVR hardware) in the same context per the device-assignment lifecycle (Phase 2 §19). |
| **Subscription** | `billing` | `plans`, `subscriptions`, `invoices`, `payments`, `transport_fees`. |

This mapping is recorded formally in `docs/architecture/adr/0001-business-entity-module-mapping.md`.
Any future request to split one of these entities into its own module is a bounded-context-boundary
change and requires a new ADR, not an ad hoc refactor.

## Migrations

Alembic. `alembic.ini` at the repo root of this deployable; revisions live in `migrations/versions/`.

## Tests

`tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/contract`, `tests/architecture` (the last enforces module
dependency-direction and import-boundary rules — see `.claude/rules/testing.md`).

## Foundation (Phase 4.2)

The application is runnable. Implemented, framework-only (no business logic):

- **App factory + lifespan** (`main.py`) — validates settings, configures logging, builds the
  DI container on startup.
- **Settings** (`core/config`) — typed `pydantic-settings`, fail-fast `validate_on_startup()`,
  one sub-config group per concern (§12.3).
- **Structured logging** (`core/logging`) — JSON formatter, request/correlation/tenant context
  binding via `contextvars`, mandatory PII/msisdn redaction (§13).
- **Exception handling** (`core/errors`) — the full `AppError` hierarchy (§14.1), HTTP status
  mapping, and the standard `{ error: {...} }` envelope, registered as global FastAPI handlers.
- **Middleware** (`interfaces/http/middleware.py`) — correlation-ID binding + request logging.
  A rate-limit hook seam is noted but not implemented (no approved policy yet).
- **Tenancy foundation** (`core/tenancy`) — `Principal`, `TenantRegionScope` types and the
  `ScopeResolver` interface (§17.4). No concrete resolution yet — needs the `organization`/
  `iam` modules.
- **Validation infra** (`core/validation`) — generic guard helpers, no business rules.
- **Event infra** (`core/events`) — `DomainEvent` envelope, `OutboxPublisher`/`EventDispatcher`/
  `BrokerPort` interfaces only (§10). No persistence or broker wiring yet.
- **UoW + repository base interfaces** (`core/db`) — `UnitOfWork`, `Repository`,
  `TenantScopedRepository` as pure interfaces (§7, §8). No SQLAlchemy/engine/tables yet.
- **Clock + ID ports** (`core/time`, `core/ids`) — `Clock`/`SystemClock` bound in DI;
  `IdGenerator` is interface-only pending the UUIDv7-vs-ULID decision (§20.2).
- **DI composition root** (`core/di`) — binds `Settings` and `Clock` today; module-specific
  ports are bound as their owning modules/infra land.
- **`/api/v1` versioning + empty module routers** (`interfaces/http/api_v1.py`) — every
  resource prefix from §16.1 is mounted, each pointing at an empty `APIRouter` in its owning
  module (`modules/<context>/api/routers.py`).
- **Health checks** (`interfaces/http/health.py`) — `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`,
  mounted unversioned since they're infra probes, not business API surface.

Deliberately **not** implemented yet (out of scope for this phase): `core/security` (JWT/RBAC),
`core/policies` (SubscriptionAccessPolicy/VideoAccessPolicy), any module's `application/`,
`domain/`, or `infra/` code, database tables/migrations, repositories, business endpoints, and
worker processes.

## Authentication & Security Foundation (Phase 4.3)

Framework-only, no login/business flows. Implemented:

- **JWT token service** (`core/security/tokens.py`) — `TokenService` interface, `JwtTokenService`
  concrete HS256 implementation (stdlib-only, no new dependency). Issues/verifies stateless
  access + refresh tokens; no refresh-token persistence or session management.
- **Password hashing** (`core/security/password_hashing.py`) — `PasswordHasher` interface,
  `Pbkdf2PasswordHasher` concrete implementation (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, stdlib `hashlib`).
- **Password policy** (`core/security/password_policy.py`) — configurable strength rules
  (`AuthSettings.password_policy`).
- **Role & Permission foundation** (`core/security/permissions.py`) — `Permission` type,
  `PermissionEvaluator` interface. No concrete RBAC matrix yet — that's authorization business
  data pending formal approval, owned by `modules/iam` when implemented.
- **Token/claims models** (`core/security/claims.py`, `tokens.py`) — `TokenClaims`, `TokenPair`.
- **Security exceptions** (`core/security/exceptions.py`) — `InvalidTokenError`,
  `TokenExpiredError`, `InvalidCredentialsError`, all `AuthenticationError` subclasses.
- **Security utilities** (`core/security/utils.py`) — constant-time compare, secure token gen.
- **Policy interfaces** (`core/policies/__init__.py`) — generic `Policy`/`PolicyDecision` shape;
  no concrete `SubscriptionAccessPolicy`/`VideoAccessPolicy` yet (pending `billing`/`video`).
- **Security middleware** (`interfaces/http/middleware.py`) — `SecurityContextMiddleware`
  verifies an inbound bearer JWT and attaches the resulting `Principal` to
  `request.state.principal` (no enforcement); `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds standard
  defensive response headers.
- **Authentication dependencies** (`interfaces/http/deps.py`) — `get_principal` /
  `get_current_user` enforce that a `Principal` was resolved (401 if not); `require_permission`
  is a dependency factory that raises `NotImplementedError` pending a bound `PermissionEvaluator`
  and approved RBAC matrix — same "fail loudly, don't fake it" policy as `get_scope`.
- **DI wiring** (`core/di/bootstrap.py`) — `PasswordHasher` always bound; `TokenService` bound
  only when `AuthSettings.jwt_secret_key` is configured (left unbound otherwise, rather than
  signing with an empty key).

Deliberately **not** implemented: login/registration/refresh endpoints, the concrete RBAC
permission matrix, refresh-token persistence, session management, external identity providers,
and OAuth — all pending `modules/iam`'s application/domain layers in a later phase.

## Database Foundation (Phase 4.4)

Framework-only, no business entities/tables/repositories. Adds three dependencies:
SQLAlchemy (async engine/ORM), Alembic (migrations), `asyncmy` (async MySQL 8.x driver).
Implemented:

- **Async engine + session factory** (`core/db/engine.py`) — `build_engine`/
  `build_session_factory`; `pool_pre_ping=True`, `expire_on_commit=False`.
- **Declarative base + naming convention** (`core/db/base.py`) — one shared `Base`/`MetaData`
  for every module's future ORM models, with `ix_`/`ux_`/`fk_`/`pk_` constraint naming
  (`.claude/rules/naming.md`).
- **Audit-column mixins** (`core/db/mixins.py`) — `UlidPrimaryKeyMixin`, `TimestampMixin`,
  `AuditActorMixin` (incl. `row_version` optimistic locking via `__mapper_args__`),
  `SoftDeleteMixin`, and the `AuditedTableMixin` bundle — the standard audit columns
  (Database Design §1) as composable mixins, not any concrete table.
- **ULID generator** (`core/ids/generator.py`) — `UlidGenerator` (stdlib-only, monotonic
  within a millisecond), resolving the Backend LLD §20.2 open item per Database Design §1's
  ULID/`CHAR(26)` decision.
- **SQLAlchemy Unit of Work** (`core/db/unit_of_work.py`) — `SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork`: opens a
  session per instance, buffers `DomainEvent`s, and writes them to the outbox in the same
  transaction as `commit()` — no module-specific repositories yet (added by each module's own
  UoW subclass later).
- **Outbox infrastructure** (`core/events/outbox.py`) — `OutboxRecord` ORM model (Database
  Design §8.8) and `OutboxWriter`, used by the UoW above. Reading/publishing pending rows
  (`OutboxPublisher`) remains a later-phase worker concern.
- **Repository infrastructure** (`core/db/repository.py`) — `SqlAlchemyRepositoryBase`: a
  generic, model-agnostic helper (session-bound CRUD, tenant/region-scope filtering,
  soft-delete-aware reads) that a module's concrete repository composes and adds its own
  aggregate mapping on top of.
- **DI wiring** (`core/di/bootstrap.py`) — `IdGenerator`/`OutboxWriter` always bound; `Engine`/
  `UnitOfWork` bound only when `DbSettings.url` is configured (same "fail loudly, don't fake
  it" policy as `TokenService`); the engine is disposed on app shutdown (`main.py`).
- **Database dependency wiring** (`interfaces/http/deps.py`) — `get_uow`: a request-scoped
  `UnitOfWork` FastAPI dependency, opened/closed per request.
- **Alembic integration** (`migrations/env.py`, `alembic.ini`) — `target_metadata =
  Base.metadata`; the connection URL is read from `raad.core.config.settings` (not
  `alembic.ini`) so there's one source of DB config; async-engine-to-sync-migration bridging
  via `AsyncConnection.run_sync`. Verified end-to-end against a real MySQL server (reached the
  authentication stage through the full engine/driver/Alembic chain).

Deliberately **not** implemented: any module ORM model, business table, or migration revision;
any module-specific repository; `application/`/`domain/` code for any module.

## Status

Application foundation only — runnable, with JWT/password-hashing security and a SQLAlchemy/
MySQL persistence foundation wired in, but no business logic, CRUD, business database tables,
or API endpoints beyond health checks exist yet.
